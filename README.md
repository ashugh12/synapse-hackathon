     ‚Üì                             ‚Üì                        ‚Üì              ‚Üì
    Web UI                    SerpAPI + Cache          AI Analysis     Gemini 2.0 API
```

### 1. üîç LinkedIn Search

* Uses SerpAPI to search Google for `site:linkedin.com/in` queries
* Extracts name, headline, and URL
* Memoizes results to avoid re-fetching
* Tracks search statistics (total results vs LinkedIn matches)

### 2. üìä Dynamic Fit Score Logic

**NEW**: Intelligent scoring system that analyzes actual candidate profiles:

| Factor            | Weight | Analysis Method |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Education         | 15%    | Detects PhD, Master's, Bachelor's degrees |
| Career Trajectory | 20%    | Identifies CTO, VP, Senior, Lead, Manager roles |
| Company Relevance | 15%    | Recognizes top-tier companies (Google, Microsoft, etc.) |
| Skills Match      | 25%    | Counts relevant tech keywords (React, Python, AWS, etc.) |
| Location Match    | 10%    | Identifies major tech hubs and remote work |
| Tenure            | 15%    | Analyzes experience indicators (5+, 10+, etc.) |

**Scoring Examples:**
- Senior React Developer at Google ‚Üí High scores (8.5+)
- Junior Developer ‚Üí Lower but realistic scores (6.0-7.0)
- CTO with 10+ years ‚Üí Very high scores (9.0+)

### 3. ü§ñ Personalized Outreach Messages

**NEW**: AI-generated messages tailored to each candidate:

* **High Scorers (8.5+)**: Enthusiastic tone, immediate opportunity
* **Good Scorers (7.0-8.4)**: Positive tone, highlight relevant experience
* **Moderate Scorers (6.0-6.9)**: Professional tone, explore interest
* **Lower Scorers (5.5-5.9)**: Exploratory tone, discuss potential fit

**Features:**
- References specific strengths from candidate profile
- Adapts tone based on fit score
- Includes clear call-to-action
- Calculates confidence based on profile completeness

## ‚úçÔ∏è Write-up

### My Approach

I built a realistic sourcing agent that mimics how a professional recruiter works:

* **Intelligent Search**: Using SerpAPI for reliable LinkedIn profile discovery
* **Dynamic Scoring**: **NEW**: AI-powered analysis of candidate profiles instead of static scores
* **Personalized Outreach**: **NEW**: Tailored messages based on candidate strengths and fit scores
* **Modern Interface**: Professional web UI for easy interaction and results visualization

### Key Improvements

* **Dynamic Scoring System**: Replaced static scores with intelligent analysis of candidate profiles
* **Personalized Outreach**: Messages now adapt to candidate fit scores and strengths
* **Confidence Calculation**: Realistic confidence levels based on profile completeness
* **Proper API Routing**: Fixed Next.js API route structure with GET/POST handlers
* **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallback mechanisms

### Technical Challenges Solved

* **JSON Parsing**: Robust parsing of Gemini API responses with fallback mechanisms
* **Dynamic Scoring**: Created algorithms to analyze candidate headlines and extract relevant information
* **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented retry logic and exponential backoff
* **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety across the application
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with modern UI components

### Scaling Plan

To scale to 100s of jobs:

* **Job Queue**: Add Bull or Temporal for batch processing
* **Database Storage**: Store LinkedIn profiles in Redis with expiry
* **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy on Vercel or Hugging Face Spaces
* **GitHub Integration**: Add real GitHub profile scraping via Octokit
* **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts and job history
* **Advanced Analytics**: Add detailed reporting and performance metrics
